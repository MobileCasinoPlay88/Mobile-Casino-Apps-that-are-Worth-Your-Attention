                <h3>Setting deposit limits</h3>
                <p>Taking control of your gaming budget is the foundation of responsible gambling. Mobile casino apps offer robust deposit limit features that help you manage your spending effectively:</p>

                <p>Important: Once you set a lower deposit limit, it takes effect immediately. However, any increase requires a 24-hour cooling-off period, protecting you from heat-of-the-moment decisions.</p>
                <h3>Using reality checks</h3>
                <p>Reality checks are your personal gaming assistant, helping you stay aware of your playing patterns. These automated notifications can:</p>

                    <li>Display your current session statistics</li>
                    <li>Provide win/loss summaries</li>
                    <li>Offer options to continue or take a break</li>
                </ul>
                <p><b>Pro tip</b>: Set reality checks at 30-60 minute intervals for optimal awareness of your gaming sessions. These reminders help you maintain control and make informed decisions about your play time.</p>
                <h3>Recognizing signs of problem gambling</h3>
